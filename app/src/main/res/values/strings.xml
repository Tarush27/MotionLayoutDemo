    <string name="description_motion_layout">MotionLayout is the new layout in Android, to create amazing interactive animations. It is a subclass of ConstraintLayout that helps to manage motion and widget animation. ConstraintLayout allows MotionLayout support to older devices from API level 14. We can define constraints just like we would do in ConstraintLayout. The difference is that MotionLayout builds upon its capabilities and we can now describe layout transitions and animate view properties changes. MotionLayout is intended to move, resize, and animate UI elements with which users interact, such as buttons and title bars. The amazing thing about MotionLayout is that it’s fully declarative. All transitions and animations might be described purely in XML. OnSwipe lets you control the motion via touch. touchAnchorId refers to the view that you can swipe and drag.touchAnchorSide means that we are dragging the view from the right side.touchRegionId Limits the region that the touch can be started into the bounds of this view (even if the view is invisible).dragDirection refers to the progress direction of the drag. For example, motion:dragDirection="dragRight" means that progress increases as you drag to the right.Before Alpha 5, MotionLayout tracked touches on the whole MotionLayout and then used the provided touchAnchorId to calculate the progress of the transition, based on the touchAnchorSide . This didn’t cover use cases where you would want to track only swipes in a specific region or on specific views. To solve the above issue, MotionLayout Alpha 5 introduces a new feature called Touch Regions.</string>
